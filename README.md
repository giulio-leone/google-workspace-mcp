# Google Workspace MCP Server

Give AI agents full access to Google Workspace — Gmail, Calendar, Drive, and more — through a single MCP server that handles multi-account credential routing, response formatting for AI consumption, and contextual guidance.

Built on [Google's official Workspace CLI](https://github.com/googleworkspace/cli) (`gws`), which means API coverage grows as Google does. The server uses a manifest-driven factory that turns declarative YAML into fully functional MCP tools — adding a new Google API operation is a config change, not a code change.

## Why This MCP Server

**Agentic First Design:** The server has been explicitly refactored to be LLM-friendly. It employs rigid `anyOf` JSON Schemas ensuring that parameter hallucinations are prevented by strictly mapping parameters to their respective operations. Tools are highly consolidated (e.g., Docs and Sheets are merged seamlessly into Drive) keeping the overall tool-count low so as not to overwhelm LLM context windows.

**For users:** One install gives your AI agent real, authenticated access to your Google accounts. Search email, check your calendar, manage Drive files, chain multi-step workflows — all through natural conversation.

**For teams:** Multi-account support means your agent can work across personal and work accounts simultaneously, with per-account credential isolation and XDG-compliant storage.

**For developers:** The factory architecture means coverage expands fast. Google's Workspace CLI already supports 15+ services and hundreds of API operations. The manifest curates which ones are exposed, patches add domain-specific formatting, and the defaults handle everything else.

## What's Available

**7 tools, 40+ operations across core services:**

| Tool | Operations | What It Does |
|------|-----------|--------------|
| `manage_email` | search, read, send, reply, replyAll, forward, triage, trash, untrash, modify, labels, threads, getThread | Full Gmail — search, read, compose, thread management, label management |
| `manage_calendar` | list, agenda, get, create, quickAdd, update, delete, calendars, freebusy | Calendar CRUD, natural language event creation, availability checks |
| `manage_drive` | search, get, upload, download, copy, delete, export, listPermissions, share, unshare, sheets_get, sheets_create, sheets_read, sheets_write, docs_get, docs_create, docs_write | Unified Drive/Docs/Sheets tool for complete file management |
| `manage_tasks` | listTaskLists, getTaskList, createTaskList, deleteTaskList, list, get, create, update, complete, delete | Manage Google Tasks and task lists |
| `manage_meet` | create | Generate Google Meet links |
| `manage_accounts` | list, authenticate, remove, status, refresh, scopes | Multi-account lifecycle — add accounts, manage credentials and scopes |
| `queue_operations` | — | Chain operations sequentially with `$N.field` result references |

Every response includes **next-steps** guidance — the agent always knows what it can do next.

## How It Works

```

The **factory** reads a YAML manifest and generates MCP tool schemas and request handlers at startup. **Patches** add domain-specific behavior where needed — Gmail search hydration, calendar formatting, Drive file type detection. Operations without patches get sensible defaults automatically.

The underlying engine is Google's `@googleworkspace/cli` — a Rust binary that wraps the full Google Workspace API surface. The MCP server curates which operations to expose and shapes the responses for AI consumption.

## Install

### MCPB Bundle (Claude Desktop and other MCP clients)

Download the `.mcpb` bundle for your platform from the [latest release](https://github.com/aaronsb/google-workspace-mcp/releases):

| Platform | File |
|----------|------|
| macOS (Apple Silicon) | `google-workspace-mcp-darwin-arm64.mcpb` |
| macOS (Intel) | `google-workspace-mcp-darwin-x64.mcpb` |
| Linux x64 | `google-workspace-mcp-linux-x64.mcpb` |
| Linux ARM64 | `google-workspace-mcp-linux-arm64.mcpb` |
| Windows x64 | `google-workspace-mcp-windows-x64.mcpb` |

In Claude Desktop, drag the `.mcpb` file into the app — it will prompt you for your Google OAuth credentials, then you're ready to go. Other MCP clients that support `.mcpb` extensions can install it the same way. The bundle includes everything: the server, the gws binary, and all dependencies.

### Claude Code / npm

```bash
npm install @aaronsb/google-workspace-mcp
```

Or run directly:

```bash
npx @aaronsb/google-workspace-mcp
```

### Prerequisites

1. **Node.js** 18+
2. **Google Cloud OAuth credentials** — create at [console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials):
   - Create an OAuth 2.0 Client ID (Desktop application)
   - Enable the APIs you want (Gmail, Calendar, Drive, Sheets, etc.)

3. Set environment variables:
   ```bash
   export GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID="your-client-id"
   export GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET="your-client-secret"
   ```

## MCP Client Configuration

### Claude Desktop

Add to `claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "google-workspace": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@aaronsb/google-workspace-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID": "your-client-id",
        "GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET": "your-client-secret"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Claude Code

Add to `.mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "google-workspace": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@aaronsb/google-workspace-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID": "your-client-id",
        "GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET": "your-client-secret"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Usage

Add an account (opens browser for OAuth):

```
manage_accounts { "operation": "authenticate" }
```

Then use any tool with your account email:

```
manage_email    { "operation": "triage", "email": "you@gmail.com" }
manage_calendar { "operation": "agenda", "email": "you@gmail.com" }
manage_drive    { "operation": "search", "email": "you@gmail.com", "query": "quarterly report" }
```

### Multi-Step Workflows

Chain operations with result references — the output of one step feeds the next:

```json
{
  "operations": [
    { "tool": "manage_email", "args": { "operation": "search", "email": "you@gmail.com", "query": "from:boss subject:review" }},
    { "tool": "manage_email", "args": { "operation": "read", "email": "you@gmail.com", "messageId": "$0.messageId" }}
  ]
}
```

## Expanding Coverage

The server discovers operations from the gws CLI, which already supports 15+ Google services (Sheets, Docs, Tasks, People, Chat, and more). Adding coverage is a manifest edit:

```bash
make manifest-discover   # Find all 287+ available operations
make manifest-lint       # Validate the curated manifest
make test                # Verify everything works
```

New operations get default formatting automatically. Add a patch only when you need domain-specific presentation.

## Data Storage

Follows XDG Base Directory Specification:

| Data | Location |
|------|----------|
| Account registry | `~/.config/google-workspace-mcp/accounts.json` |
| Credentials | `~/.local/share/google-workspace-mcp/credentials/` |

Credentials are per-account files with standard OAuth tokens. No secrets are stored in the project directory.
